# SumoBot
A Sumobot is  an autonomous robot programmed to push other Sumobots out of a ring (see actual_pic3.jpg) without getting pushed out itself.
<br/>
This Sumobot is composed of 4 Ultrasonic Proximity Sensors (1 in the front, 1 each sides and 1 in the back). These 4 Ultrasonic Sensors are used to detect other nearby Sumobots and attacked them. We used light sensors in each corner of the Sumobot to detect the white line of the ring and to avoid being pushed outside the ring. We used arduino nano to programmed our Sumobot. With proper used of motors and motor driver and enough power to drive the Sumobot, the Sumobot runs properly.

This Sumobot ranked 1 in our class.
